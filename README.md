# Solar-Radiation-Prediction and Measuring value of solar radiation
-by Shreyansh Jain, Arushi Mahawar and Yash Gupta students from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra

This is my project on machine learning and Solar Energy. Languages included : Python

# Goal : 
To predict the level of solar radition from the measurements and also measure the values using solar cell using embedded system i.e with the help of Arduino.

# Problem statement :
The dataset contains such columns as: "wind direction", "wind speed", "humidity" and temperature. The response parameter that is to be predicted is: "Solar_radiation". It contains measurements for the past 4 months and you have to predict the level of solar radiation.

# This project has following parts :
1. Measurement of Value through Solar cell using embedded system i.e with the help of Arduino.<br/>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis : In this I pre processed the raw data into meaningful numeric data and performed initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.<br/>
3. Correlation : In this part I have shown how data is correlated with the help of heatmap.<br/>
4. Model Building : Here I split the train data into training and validation set so that it become easy to validate the results of our model on the validation set. We will keep 30% data as validation set and rest as the training set.<br/>
5. Machine Learning algorithm : To check the performance of my dataset I have used a machine learning technique i.e Linear regression where I have predicted the Linear Regression model and evaluated the regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)<br/>
